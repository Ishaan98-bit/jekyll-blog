<p><strong>Things to Remember:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Be clear about what you fill in the occupation section, merely writing â€˜Serviceâ€™ or â€˜Private Jobâ€™ will not be sufficient. Mention the sector you work in as well as your designation.</li>
  <li>Go early in the morning, around 8:00 AM â€“ 8.30 AM, this way you will be able to dodge long queue. Also, you will get free early, and shall have the chance to reach Thimphu/Paro before evening, as both the places are at a good 5-6 hours long drive from Phuentsholing.</li>
  <li>In case you forgot to take photocopies of the required document, there are shops just opposite the Immigration Office for photostat.</li>
  <li>Through this Tourist Permit, you can go to Thimphu, Paro and Punakha. Please note that in order to visitÂ <a href="https://www.tourmyindia.com/international/bhutan/bumthang/">Bumthang</a>Â and other tourist places in Bhutan, a separate permit is required.</li>
  <li>From July 2020, a daily fee of INR 1200 will have to be paid by Indian tourists visiting Bhutan.</li>
  <li>To expedite and ease the process of permit obtaining, the Department of Immigration, Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs and the Tourism Council of Bhutan have launched the Online Permit System, which facilitates the online processing of permits through registered Bhutanese tour operators and TCB certified hotels.</li>
