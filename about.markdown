For more than 10 years I worked my ass off. Always trying to be the best. Always waiting for that next promotion. Always aiming to earn more money.

And I did. I got the fancy job and the promotions, the good salary and the oh-so-important big car. I bought myself some designer handbags and a house full of other useless shit, traveled whenever I could and thought I had it all. I also spent 10 hours a day at work and turned my computer back on as soon as I’d finished having dinner at home… The days I wouldn’t just work through dinner, that is…

I got a nice house with a garden. Spent a small fortune on ‘stuff’… curtains, plants and decorations – as if I was gonna die if I had to put the same decorations in my Christmas tree two years in a row… I also spent 90% of my free time renovating and plucking weeds…

Then I realized that NONE of my most memorable moments involved ANY of the possessions and ‘accomplishments’ mentioned above. That I was happier sleeping in a € 5 dorm room, spending 15 hours in a shabby bus and carrying my stuff around in a € 25 fake leather handbag that was holding together with safety-pins…

 

So I decided to leave
My perfect job, my boyfriend of 8,5 years, my house, my comfort, the pressure of always having to be the best, the constant need to prove myself, everything… No more dreaming about getting the hell out of there. No more convincing myself that ‘everybody lives like this, so you can too! ‘. No more waiting for someday…

‘Someday I’ll make that trip I’ve always dreamed about. Someday I’ll work less and enjoy life more. Someday I’ll do whatever the hell I want without worrying about what everybody else thinks.’

 

MY SOMEDAY WAS GOING TO BE RIGHT NOW!

 

It took me a while to get everything sorted – getting through a burnout and selling a house takes time! You can read a bit more about the burnout here, or read this article that I wrote last year for my 1st blog anniversary if you want to have some more background.
